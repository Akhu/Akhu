## 🔧 Tech Enthusiast Since Day One

I've been passionate about **hardware** since forever — tinkering, building, understanding how things work from the ground up. This hands-on curiosity naturally evolved into software, robotics, and now agentic systems.

**Vision:** I dream of building **sovereign European digital technology and robotics** 🇪🇺 — reducing our dependence on US/China tech and creating homegrown innovation that reflects our values.

## 🌟 Philosophy

> "Engineers and businesspeople are trained to solve problems. Designers are trained to discover the real problems."  
> — Donald Norman

I believe great work comes from **motivation, trust, and collaboration**. Quality isn't just about tools and methods — it's about the people and the culture.

**Inspirations:**
- 📐 **Donald Norman & Jakob Nielsen** — design thinking & UX theory
- 🎬 **Ed Catmull** — leadership, creativity, and team dynamics
- 🎭 **Alexandre Astier** — creative perseverance and storytelling
